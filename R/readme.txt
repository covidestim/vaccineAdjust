If you want to create an RDS file with the relative risk for all states + counties,
1. open run.R, 
2. set working directory to the root directory file where all these files are stored
3. run the script. this will create an RR.RDS file, and finally a plot of the RR in Arizona, to check for reasonable output.
it should take ~1 minute to run
